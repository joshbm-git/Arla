        <ul>
          <li>The cow's feed</li>
          <li>
            When the cow digests the feed, the natural gas methane is produced
            and is released through burps. Changing the feed composition can
            make the cow less gassy.
          </li>

          <li>Feed production</li>
          <li>
            Efficient feed production ensures that there is just the right
            amount of nutrients to grow the crops and it minimises the nutrients
            lost during storage, handling and usage in the fields. This not only
            reduces the climate impact but also improves profitability on the
            farm.
          </li>

          <li>Manure handling</li>
          <li>
            Manure used for biogas production reduces emissions and produces
            renewable energy. When manure is used in the fields, it should be
            incorporated into the soil as fast as possible to reduce the loss of
            nitrogen.
          </li>

          <li>Renewable energy</li>
          <li>
            The farm can produce renewable energy through solar panels, biogas
            or wind turbines. Currently the electricity produced on Arla farms
            equals 61% of their total electricity usage.
          </li>

          <li>Animal welfare</li>
          <li>
            As the cow doesn’t produce milk the first two years of its life, the
            total emissions per kilo of milk during its lifetime are reduced the
            longer it lives and the more milk it produces. It is a proven fact
            that better animal welfare improves a cow's milk yield and
            life-span.
          </li>

          <li>Fuel</li>
          <li>
            The machinery, tractors etc. on farm can be changed to models using
            less fuel and more non-fossil fuels. Farmers can practice
            eco-driving to reduce mileage and fuel usage per kilometer.
          </li>

          <li>Carbon sequestration</li>
          <li>
            Carbon sequestration (capturing and storing carbon in the soil) can
            increase, particularly when growing grass and using manure.
          </li>

          <li>Trees and plants</li>
          <li>
            The farmer can plant more trees, bushes, hedges and flowers on his
            land, which will not only help absorb CO2 but also improve
            biodiversity.
